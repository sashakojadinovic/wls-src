            <p class="bubble question"> Mark, I have a question for you, Mr. Knows-It-All.</p>

        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>The stuff inside this old lab thermometer that expands and shrinks when the
                temperature changes is
                called mercury?</p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong>That's right. But you should be careful with mercury — it's a poisonous
                substance.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> Thanks for the warning, but this is just an imaginary experiment. So imagine a
                tiny drop of mercury sitting on a table, like a little silver ball. Could we split that mercury ball
                into two smaller ones?</p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong> We could.</p>
            <p><strong> Sara: </strong> And then split each of those again, and again, and again…</p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong> Yep, we could keep dividing that drop into smaller and smaller bits, many, many
                times.</p>
            <p><strong> Sara: </strong> And no matter how many times we split it, it would still be mercury?</p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong> Hmm… not forever. Eventually, we’d get to a point where we hit the tiniest bit
                of mercury we could no
                longer split easily. And if we did split it again, it wouldn't be mercury anymore.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> So that means there’s such a thing as... the tiniest bit of a substance?</p>
            <p><strong> Marko: </strong>Exactly. Every substance is made up of very tiny particles that have the same
                properties as the
                substance itself — and they are the substance.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I even know what those particles are called in science &#128526;</p>
            <p><strong> Marko: </strong> I bet you do — it's a pretty famous science word. But let’s not say it just
                yet. We'll dive into it
                properly in another lesson.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> They're called atoms, molecules, and ions!</p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong> SARA!</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Okay, okay, I’ll stop! Let’s just call them “particles” for now.</p>
            <p><strong> Marko: </strong> Deal. We’ll say every substance is made of tiny particles — and in science,
                they have fancy names
                like atoms, molecules, and ions. </p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong> MARK! </p>
            <p><strong>Marko: </strong> Oops, sorry! Right. Just... “particles.” The tiniest bits of a substance that
                still are that
                substance.</p>

                now we all know!
                These are the tiniest particles of a substance, and each one keeps the properties of that substance.
                We’ll talk more about them another time, but for now, the most important thing to remember is:
                They exist, and every substance is made up of one of these three types of particles.</p>
