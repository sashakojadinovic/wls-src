            <p class="bubble question">You just don‚Äôt get it, do you?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>You said you're melting. I know substances can change their state‚Äîusually when we
                heat or cool them. We do it all the time. To get ice, we put water in the freezer.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And when we boil water for tea, it turns into a gas called water vapor?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Exactly. We see substances change their state every day. And these changes have
                names: evaporation, condensation, melting, freezing‚Ä¶</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Of course I know all that, Marko. Condensation, for example, happens when a gas
                becomes a liquid. Like when the warm air from our room hits the cold window in winter.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Right. We know those ones. But do you know what sublimation is?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Sublimation? Sounds familiar.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>It‚Äôs when a substance goes straight from solid to gas. Kinda weird, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Wait, can that even happen? üòè</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>It can! Take iodine, for example. It's solid at room temperature, but when you
                heat it, it doesn't melt‚Äîit turns directly into a purple gas.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I love purple! You‚Äôll show me someday, right? üòç</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Promise.</p>

  If you‚Äôre not sure, check out this fun <a class="simple-link-light" href="/chemistry/state-of-matter.html">lesson on solids, liquids, and gases</a> first! <br>
                We‚Äôve learned that substances can change state, and each type of change has a name.
                Sara says she understands it best when she draws how they‚Äôre connected‚Äîso she shared her diagram with
                us.</p>

            <p class="bubble info">There‚Äôs a gas that freezes by evaporating‚Äîit‚Äôs carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ)! When CO‚ÇÇ changes
                from gas to solid at normal pressure, it skips the liquid phase. That‚Äôs sublimation! <br>

                But something really cool can happen: if gas CO‚ÇÇ is cooled quickly, some of it can both sublimate and
                condense at once. This makes a snowy fog made of tiny solid CO‚ÇÇ particles. It looks like white smoke,
                but it‚Äôs actually dry ice turning back into gas! That‚Äôs why <strong>dry ice</strong> is used in theaters
                and concerts‚Äîto make fog that doesn‚Äôt leave any water behind.</p>
