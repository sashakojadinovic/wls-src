            <p class="bubble question">In our last lesson, we talked <a title="Pure substances" href="/en/chemistry/pure-substances.html">about pure substances</a>, but we also said that in nature, most things are actually made by mixing two or more pure substances.</p>

            <p class="bubble answer">That's right. So what do we call substances that are mixtures of pure substances?</p>

            <img src="/images/avatars/sara/sara2.svg" width="100" height="106" alt="Sara's avatar" class="avatar" />
            <p class="bubble question">We call them mixtures. I didn’t forget!</p>

            <p class="bubble answer">I knew you'd remember. So today we’ll dive deeper into mixtures. Anything specific you want to know?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>First off, how can I tell if something is a pure substance or a mixture?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Good question! Sometimes it’s really easy. For example, if you can clearly see different parts that are different colors or states, it's a mixture.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So sometimes it’s not that obvious? Maybe when the substances are mixed so well that we can’t tell them apart?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Exactly! And that’s where we get to two types of mixtures — based on how well things are mixed.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I'm listening!</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>If the substances are not perfectly mixed and you can still see the different parts, or if the composition isn’t the same throughout, it’s called a <strong>HETEROGENEOUS MIXTURE</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>So things like sand, chocolate with nuts, and fizzy drinks would be heterogeneous mixtures?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Exactly! Most mixtures around us are like that. But if the substances are mixed so well that we can't tell them apart, and the composition is the same everywhere — then it's a <strong>HOMOGENEOUS MIXTURE</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>I’ve heard the words "homogeneous" and "heterogeneous" before, not just in chemistry.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Yep! "Homogeneous" means uniform — the same all the way through, while "heterogeneous" means varied or different in different parts.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Got it. Let me guess — homogeneous mixtures are less common in nature because it's harder to get everything that perfectly mixed?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>You're spot on. In nature, homogeneous mixtures are rarer. Examples would be clear solutions, like seawater, or mixtures of gases like air.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>That makes sense. Like how in a glass of seawater we can’t see the salt, and it tastes the same throughout.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>And both types — homogeneous and heterogeneous — can be found in all three states of matter.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Milk — a sneaky heterogeneous mixture</h3>
        <p>Even though it looks like a perfectly uniform liquid, milk is actually a heterogeneous mixture. It contains water, fat, proteins, and other ingredients that are well blended but not fully dissolved. Tiny fat droplets float in the water, making milk an emulsion — a special type of heterogeneous mixture. That’s why milk can spoil without immediately changing its appearance!</p>
