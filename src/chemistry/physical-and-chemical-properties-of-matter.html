        </div>
        <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>And how tall are you?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>About 6 feet tall. Butâ€¦ you can see me â€” why are you asking?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Six feet? Maybe with rocket shoes! ðŸ˜„ But thatâ€™s not the point. Do you know
                what todayâ€™s lesson is about?</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>My physical features?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Not yours exactly â€” but close! We're learning about the <em>physical and
                    chemical properties</em> of substances.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Oh, so you mean substances have physical properties, just like people have
                physical features?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Exactly! We can observe a personâ€™s physical features with our senses, or
                measure them â€” like your height or eye color.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>So with substances, we can also use our senses â€” like color, smell, or if
                something is a solid, liquid, or gas. And we can measure things like boiling point or density.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Thatâ€™s right! You're a science star. You just need to learn how to measure
                your height properly. ðŸ˜„</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>If you keep teasing me, Iâ€™m not talking to you anymore!</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Donâ€™t be mad! Actuallyâ€¦ that gives me a perfect transition to chemical
                properties.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>Wait â€” what does <em>me getting mad</em> have to do with chemical properties?
            </p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Well, just like people have character traits â€” like being calm, nervous, or
                maybe lazy â€” substances have <em>chemical properties</em>.</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>I seeâ€¦ So people show their personality when they interact with others. Just
                like substances show chemical properties when they interact with other substances?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Exactly! Iron rusts when it reacts with air. Silver turns dark over time. And
                some substances even catch fire when they meet oxygen at high temperatures!</p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>So when something can catch fire easily, we say itâ€™s <em>flammable</em>.
                Thatâ€™s a chemical property.</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Yes! And when a substance reacts quickly and easily with others, itâ€™s called
                <em>reactive</em>.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Mark: </strong>And if it reacts slowly â€” or barely at all â€” we say itâ€™s <em>chemically
                    inert</em>. That means kind of lazy, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Sara: </strong>Yup! See? Even chemicals have personalities â€” just like us!</p>

                Sara and Marko did a great job understanding what physical and chemical properties of a substance are.
                Let's wrap up what weâ€™ve learned and explain it using scientific language.

                <dd>
                    These are the properties we can observe with our senses (sight, smell, taste...) or measure
                    precisely.
                    Examples include color, smell, taste, state of matter, solubility in water, boiling point,
                    electrical conductivity, density, and many others.

                <dt>Chemical properties of a substance</dt>
                <dd>
                    These describe how a substance behaves when it comes into contact with other substances â€” whether
                    and how quickly it reacts, and what changes or new substances are formed as a result.
                    Examples of chemical properties include flammability, tendency to corrode, and reactivity.

        <h2 class="section-title">Science Fun Fact: Hydrogen and Clean Energy</h2>
        <div class="dialogue-turn show-after-3" data-speaker="Teacher">
                       <img src="/images/cartoons/rocket-30-degrees.svg" width="350" height="270" alt="Sara rocket girl" class="half-width-mobile"  />

            <p class="bubble info">Did you know that hydrogen is one of the most flammable substances in nature?</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Hydrogen: Rocket Fuel and a Future Green Energy Source</h3>
        <p>
            Hydrogen is so flammable that when mixed with air and ignited, it produces an enormous flame and a powerful
            explosion!
            Thatâ€™s why hydrogen fuel is used in space exploration â€” it burns fast and delivers a huge energy output.
        </p>
        <p>
            But hydrogen isnâ€™t just rocket fuel. Itâ€™s also seen as a key clean energy source of the future. Why?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ultra-low density:</strong> Hydrogen is the lightest known gas in the universe, which makes it
                ideal for aerospace and other advanced technologies.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero harmful emissions:</strong> When hydrogen burns, it produces only pure water â€” no carbon
                dioxide or other greenhouse gases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With these properties, hydrogen is becoming a top contender in the world of green energy and sustainable
            fuel solutions.
