  <h2>What’s the difference between a physical and a chemical change?</h2>

      <img src="/images/avatars/sara/sara-white-hair-happy.svg" width="100" height="106" alt="Sara's avatar" class="avatar" />
      <p class="bubble question">Ha-ha. What about my hair?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue-turn show-after-2" data-speaker="Mark">
      <img src="/images/avatars/mark/mark.svg" width="100" height="106" alt="Mark's avatar" class="avatar" />
      <p class="bubble answer">Oh, right—you changed your hair color!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="dialogue-mix show-after-3" data-speaker="Mark and Sara">
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Good! You noticed the change in me.</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Changes happen in nature all the time. It's fun to observe them.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Am I part of nature too?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Of course!</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Then nature must be beautiful, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Nature is the most beautiful thing there is.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Great, now I’ll actually listen to you. Go on, science star!</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Matter is always moving and changing. And we divide changes into two types: physical and chemical changes.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Just like <a class="inline-link" href="/chemistry/physical-and-chemical-properties-of-matter.html" title="Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter">properties of matter can be physical and chemical</a>?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Exactly. If a new substance is created, it’s a chemical change. If not, it’s a physical change.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> What kind of change is it when we freeze water?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Does it turn into a new substance, Sara?</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> No. It becomes ice, but ice is still water—just in a different <a href="/chemistry/state-of-matter.html" class="inline-link" title="State of Matter">state</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Right! Freezing, like other changes of state, is a physical change—because no new substance is formed.</p>
      <p><strong>Sara:</strong> Got it! And when we burn a piece of charcoal while making a barbecue, the black stuff turns into something else, right? So that's a chemical change?</p>
      <p><strong>Mark:</strong> Yes! Burning charcoal produces carbon dioxide gas—a completely new substance with different properties and particles.</p>

          <li><strong>Physical change:</strong> The wax melts. It just changes from solid to liquid—its substance stays the same.</li>
          <li><strong>Chemical change:</strong> The flame burns the wax and turns it into gases like carbon dioxide and water vapor—these are new substances!</li>
