                Snake venom contains hundreds of different proteins and enzymes. Some of them affect blood pressure, blood clotting, or the nervous system. Scientists study these compounds and use them to create medicines that mimic venom’s effects – but in controlled and safe doses!
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>For example, the drug <strong>Captopril</strong>, which lowers blood pressure, was developed by studying the venom of a Brazilian snake called <em>Bothrops jararaca</em>.</p>

        <p>Other drugs help prevent dangerous blood clots – which is important for avoiding heart attacks and strokes. Some researchers are even exploring ways to use snake toxins to deliver medicine directly to cancer cells!</p>
