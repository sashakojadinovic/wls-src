            <p class="bubble answer">Yeah! Summer wouldn’t be the same without those colorful rainbows. Remember when we talked about <a style="color:#ffffff" href="/fun-science-facts/why-is-the-sky-blue.html">why the sky is blue</a>? We said that a rainbow appears when sunlight is split into the colors it’s made of. But… have you noticed the rainbow always has the same colors in the same order?</p>

            <p class="bubble question">Hmm, you’re right! It’s always red on top, then orange, yellow… and at the bottom, there’s blue and purple. But why?</p>

                A rainbow appears when sunlight passes through tiny drops of water in the air. Each drop acts like a little prism – it bends and splits the light into its basic colors.

        <div class="svg-wrapper">
            <img width="332" height="289" src="/images/cartoons/rainbow.svg" alt="Rainbow color order">
        </div>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Why this exact order?</h2>
        <p>
            Sunlight is made of many different wavelengths. Red light has the longest wavelength, while violet has the shortest. 
            When light enters a water droplet, each color bends at a slightly different angle. 
            Red bends the least, so it’s always on the top of the rainbow, while violet bends the most and ends up at the bottom.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">Cool, right?</h2>
        <p>
            That’s why a rainbow always has the same color order: <strong>red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet</strong>. 
            And if you ever see a double rainbow, the second one has the colors reversed!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Mini experiment</h3>
        <p>
            Take a glass of water and place it in sunlight. Look carefully at the wall or floor – you’ll see a tiny “piece of a rainbow”! 
            You can also do this with a glass prism if you have one.
