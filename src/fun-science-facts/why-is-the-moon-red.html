    <h2>The Phenomenon Called the Blood Moon</h2>

    <section class="dialogue" aria-label="Dialogue between Mark and Sara about lunar eclipse">

            <p class="bubble question">You know, I got a little scared last night when I looked at the Moon.</p>
        </div>

            <p class="bubble answer">Oh yeah, it looked super red! But I wasn’t scared. When you understand where these natural things come from, there's no reason to be afraid. We’re not living in the Middle Ages, after all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-turn show-after-1" data-speaker="Sara">

            <p class="bubble question">Okay smarty-pants, then explain it to me.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue-turn show-after-2" data-speaker="Mark">
            <img src="/images/avatars/mark/mark-happy.svg" width="100" height="106" alt="Mark's avatar" class="avatar" />
            <p class="bubble answer">It’s actually called a lunar eclipse — but I think it’s best if we let the teacher explain it properly.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="resume">
        <h2 class="section-title">The Teacher Explains</h2>

        <div class="dialogue-turn show-after-3" data-speaker="Teacher">
            <img src="/images/avatars/teacher/teacher.svg" width="100" height="106" alt="Teacher avatar" class="avatar" />
            <p class="bubble info">The Blood Moon isn’t scary at all — it’s just a total lunar eclipse!</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">What Is a Lunar Eclipse?</h2>

        <div class="flex">
            <img class="rounded" width="144" height="144" src="/images/animations/lunar-eclipse.gif" alt="Red Moon during eclipse">
            <p>A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth moves right between the Sun and the Moon, and Earth’s shadow falls on the Moon. But even then, some sunlight still reaches the Moon — through Earth's atmosphere!</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">So Why Is the Moon Red?</h2>
        <p>When sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere, shorter light waves like blue and violet get scattered in all directions. But longer waves — like red and orange — pass through more easily. That reddish light is what reaches the Moon during the eclipse, making it look red to us!</p>

        <h3>Does It Happen Often?</h3>
        <p>Total lunar eclipses don’t happen very often, but when they do — they’re amazing to watch! And unlike solar eclipses, they are completely safe to watch with the naked eye.</p>
