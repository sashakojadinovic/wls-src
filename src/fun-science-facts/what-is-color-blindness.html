                Color blindness (daltonism) is a condition where a person can't tell some colors apart â€” usually red and green. 
                Our eyes have special cells called cones that detect light. There are three types of cones: for red, green, and blue.
                If one of these doesnâ€™t work properly, the brain doesnâ€™t get the right signals, and the person canâ€™t see all colors clearly.
            </p>
        </div>      

        <h2 class="section-title">Cool fact: itâ€™s like how computers work!</h2>
        <p>
            Screens on phones and computers use the same idea â€” they show colors by combining red (R), green (G), and blue (B) light.
            This is called the <strong>RGB model</strong>. Just like our eyes, they mix these three lights to create all the colors we see.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Who has color blindness?</h2>
        <p>
            Around <strong>8% of boys</strong> and less than <strong>1% of girls</strong> have some form of color blindness.
            Itâ€™s usually inherited through genes. Thereâ€™s no cure, but people with this condition can live totally normal lives.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Fun facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some insects can see more colors than humans â€” even ultraviolet light!</li>
            <li>There are special glasses that help some people see colors better â€” but they donâ€™t work for everyone.</li>
            <li>Color blindness is named after <strong>John Dalton</strong> (1776â€“1844), an English scientist who had this condition himself. Youâ€™ll hear more about him in our lesson on atoms. ðŸ™‚</li>
            <li>If humans had a fourth type of cone in the eye, we could possibly see new colors â€” even beyond violet!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">What is the Ishihara test?</h2>
        <div class="flex">
            <img width="200" height="200" src="/images/fun-science-facts/isihara-test.webp"
                alt="Ishihara test example" />
            <p>
                Search online for images made of colorful dots that hide a number â€” those are called <strong>Ishihara tests</strong>.  
                If the number is hard to see, you might have mild color blindness (or maybe your screen is just too dark ðŸ˜Š).
